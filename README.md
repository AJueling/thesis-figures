# thesis-figures
Figures of Chapters 1 (Introduction), 2 (CESM overview), and 6 (CESM reponse) of my thesis entitled "Climate Variability and Response in High-Resolution Earth System Models"

Files:
- `*.ipynb` notebooks with code to produce figures and the figures themselves, some contain superfluous code
- `*.py` python files with auxiliary functions, likely contain unused functions
- `environment.yml` conda environment file

The Figures are unfortunately not immediately reproducible for several reasons:
- Surfsara's Cartesius is currently replaced by the new HPC Snellius, so paths will need to be adjusted and the environment.yml file may not produce a viable conda environment
- the CESM output data is too large to publicly store, but is in principle available upon request
- data is downloaded from the respective publications
